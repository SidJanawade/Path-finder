# Python-Pathfinding 
Pathfinding algorithms for python 3.

Currently there are 7 path-finders bundled in this library, namely:

- A*
- Dijkstra
- Best-First
- Bi-directional A*
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Iterative Deeping A* (IDA*)
- Minimum Spanning Tree (MSP)
- Dijkstra and A* take the weight of the fields on the map into account.
